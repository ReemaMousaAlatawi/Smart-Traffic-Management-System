# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System

### Real-Time Object Detection & Multi-Object Tracking

**YOLOv5 + Deep SORT + OpenCV**

---

## 📖 Introduction

This project is a real-time traffic monitoring and object tracking system that combines **YOLOv5** for object detection with **Deep SORT** for multi-object tracking.

The system detects and tracks vehicles and other objects in traffic video streams while maintaining a unique ID for each detected object across frames.

This project demonstrates how **Computer Vision, Object Detection, and Multi-Object Tracking** can be combined to build intelligent traffic monitoring solutions.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReemaMousaAlatawi/ReemaMousaAlatawi.git
cd ReemaMousaAlatawi
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or later** installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Tracker

### Run the included traffic video

```bash
python track.py --source videos/Traffic.mp4
```

### Run using a webcam

```bash
python track.py --source 0
```

### Run another video

```bash
python track.py --source path/to/video.mp4
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- The system uses YOLOv5 for object detection.
- Deep SORT is used to maintain unique IDs for tracked objects.
- The included `Traffic.mp4` video can be used to test the tracker.
- The tracker supports both video files and webcam input.
